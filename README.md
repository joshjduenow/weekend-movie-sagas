# Movie Sagas

This project is the product of lessons learned from Sagas and how it works with the React environment.

## Description

For this project, I opted to create components for :

- App
- Movie Details
- Movie Items
- Movie List

These components all took input from a Store.js , details, genre and movie routers.

A database was built in SQL which stored the data from each movie and was pulled in and renered on the DOM.

I was able to complete some styling using CSS, MUI and some bootstrap.
